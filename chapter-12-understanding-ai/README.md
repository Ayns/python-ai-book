# Chapter 12: Understanding AI: The Big Picture
Conceptual chapter — what is AI, ML, Deep Learning, GenAI? Tokens, context windows, temperature, cost optimization, safety and ethics.

## Code: Concept Demonstrations
Run: `python concepts.py`

No API key needed — this file demonstrates token estimation and cost calculations.

## What You'll Learn
- AI → ML → Deep Learning → GenAI
- How LLMs work (next-token prediction)
- Tokens, context windows, temperature
- Cost estimation
- AI safety: hallucinations, bias, prompt injection, privacy
