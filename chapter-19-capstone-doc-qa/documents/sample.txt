Python Programming Language

Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy
emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Python is
dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms,
including structured, object-oriented, and functional programming.

Python was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde and
Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language.
Its implementation began in December 1989. Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility
for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his
permanent vacation from his responsibilities as Python's chief architect.

Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages. It is used
by many large organizations including Google, NASA, Netflix, and Instagram. Python is
particularly popular in data science, machine learning, web development, and automation.

The Python Package Index (PyPI) hosts over 500,000 third-party packages. Popular
packages include NumPy for numerical computing, Pandas for data analysis, Django and
Flask for web development, and TensorFlow and PyTorch for machine learning.
